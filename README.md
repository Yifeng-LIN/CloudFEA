# Creation of a Cloud-Based Finite Element Analysis Pipeline

Introduction:
In the ever-evolving world of engineering, it's essential to embrace innovative technologies that can optimize design processes and unlock new possibilities. One such technology (I think) is the cloud-based Finite Element Analysis (FEA) pipeline. In this article, I'll guide you through the key steps involved in creating this pipeline, demonstrating how it can enhance your engineering workflows. Join me on this journey as we explore the potential of cloud computing and open-source tools in engineering design.

Step 1: Set up Azure PaaS - Embrace Cloud Flexibility:
The first step in building a cloud-based FEA pipeline is configuring Azure Platform as a Service (PaaS). Azure provides a powerful cloud server, transforming it into your versatile engineering workstation. This setup offers the flexibility to work from anywhere, at any time, leveraging the high-performance computing capabilities of the cloud.

Step 2: Install Gmesh and Code_Aster - Laying the Foundation:
Next, we install Gmesh and Code_Aster, open-source tools controlled using Python code. Gmesh facilitates geometry creation, while Code_Aster enables you to define materials, boundary conditions, and loads. Together, these tools establish the basis for accurate structure simulations on the cloud.

Step 3: Create and customize the Post-Processors with python - Expanding Your Capabilities:
Customizing the post-processor unlocks a world of possibilities. Imagine having a viewer to explore and analyze design margins, an optimizer for fine-tuning dimensions through automated iterations, and a report generator providing concise and actionable insights. This flexibility extends to integrating additional post-processors, enhancing your analytical capabilities.

Step 4: Launch a Web Server - Transforming Your Pipeline:
By launching a web server, your FEA pipeline evolves into a Software as a Service (SaaS) application, accessible to anyone, anytime, and anywhere. This cloud-based service, coupled with high-performance computing capabilities, delivers instant results when inputting design parameters. It accelerates iteration cycles, provides intuitive insights, and empowers you to focus on design optimization.

Summary:
In conclusion, a cloud-based FEA pipeline offers significant benefits to engineering design processes. By following the four key steps outlined above, you can harness the power of the cloud and open-source tools to compress engineering calculations from days to minutes.
